Congratulations! You have entered into the lucrative business of Lithium Mining. The greatest of all alkali metals. I am you friendly guide... your... assistant you might say and my name is Lalapagaduweewee. As I'm sure you learnt when you were but a small waffle, lithium mining is all about moderation. I'll also remind you that as you learnt in kinderarteggfan school, the optimum amount of lithium is 468 lithiums. Any more and you will wake up in your bed all vumberscoobed and with no lithium to speak of! NOW! PAY ATTENTION: To mine lithium simply type in an 'l' to your lithium command terminal sysgerafific. Have fun! And remember: with lithium your risk of being recycled by the enchantatle is significantly reduced!
